Q: When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When there are multiple people working on the
same project, or I am working from different
computers (e.g. work, home, etc.)

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: In the case where someone else is working on the
project, I would want to make sure that their code
doesn't get mixed up with mine before I am ready to merge

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones,
and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: fork is GitHub specific and used to copy Github
repositories. Clone is used to copy a github repository
onto my personal machine. Branches is used to create
different versions of a project only on my local machine.

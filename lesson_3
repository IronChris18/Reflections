Q: When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When there are multiple people working on the
same project, or I am working from different
computers (e.g. work, home, etc.)

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: In the case where someone else is working on the
project, I would want to make sure that their code
doesn't get mixed up with mine before I am ready to merge

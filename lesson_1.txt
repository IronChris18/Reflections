Q: How did viewing a diff b/t 2 versions of a file help to see a bug?

A: It showed which lines had been added/removed so I can see how the added
line differs from the old line.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: I would be able to see all the different changes that I've made,
and I would easily learn from any of my mistakes.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A: Pros: easier to go back and look at changes, more logical
	Cons: might forget to commit and could lose code
	
Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: So that we don't forget to commit certain individual files.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view
the history of files?

A: Get the revision ids from git log and use git diff to compare the 2

Q: How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that could break something?

A: I would always know that I can go back to the way it was with ease,
and now I can test theories without worry.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

A: School work and eventually real-world job stuff

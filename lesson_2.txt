Q: What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

A: creates a .git file, and I need it to be able to commit... or something

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A: staging area is a place to get files ready to go to git, but they
aren't actually there yet. working directory is where all the files originate.
It gives us the opportunity to check our commit logic before committing

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have
one commit per logical change?

A: Use git diff without arguments to see differences b/t working
directory and staging area
